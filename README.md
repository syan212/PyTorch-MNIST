# PyTorch-MNIST
A simple(and probaly terrible) PyTorch model trained to recognise the MNIST dataset.
## How to use
1. Run neural_training_mnist.py to train the network and create mnist_best_model.pth(for the number of epochs, I recommend 100-200)
2. Run neural_mnist.py to see the results(it uses the model with the highest average accuracy across both the training and test data)
